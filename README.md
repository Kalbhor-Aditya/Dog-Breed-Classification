# Dog Breed Classification 

This project focuses on the task of classifying images of dogs into their respective breeds.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of 10,222 images spanning 120 unique breeds of dogs. 

## Model

The model used for this classification task is MobileNetV2. MobileNetV2 is a highly efficient convolutional neural network architecture that's designed to be used in applications where computational resources are limited.

## Performance

The MobileNetV2 model achieved an accuracy of 99.90% on this task, demonstrating its effectiveness at image classification tasks.

## Usage

To use this model, simply pass an image of a dog to the model, and it will return the breed of the dog.

## Future Work

Future work could involve expanding the dataset to include more breeds or more images per breed. Additionally, other models could be explored to see if they can achieve higher accuracy.
